<h2 id="why-mens-group-is-not-enough">Why Men’s Group is not enough</h2>
<p>In order to foster friendship and growth we need intimate settings where we can be vulnerable with each other. Men’s group in a broad/generic way is not able to provide this context</p>
<p>The first principle of BoSD is fidelity to your brothers in prayer. We each bind ourselves to the duty of praying our portion each day. This is a shared struggle that unites us. We are busy, frantic even, and this duty serves to forge us into a Band of Brothers with a common struggle.</p>
<p>Generic Men’s Group cannot place that obligation on participants. {An assumption – Why is this so?]<br>
Generic Men’s Group may be the context for social fellowship, but even then, it should be renamed in order to give it some sense of purpose. For now, let’s call it Men Of Saint Anne’s (MOSA).<br>
Let MOSA be the structure for large social gathering.</p>
<p>Within BoSD, our daily rule is our corporate identity and because we have this common work, the small groups – synaxes – can be the context for much deeper, open, vulnerable relationships.<br>
If the Rule of the Psalms is our uniform and training, the synaxis is our front-lines, our trenches, our battery.</p>
<p>The Brotherhood is the Platoon.<br>
The Synaxis is the Squad.<br>
Our fight is Unseen Warfare.<br>
Our Enemy is Apathy, the shadows in our hearts, and the immaterial forces of evil that break like waves against our familes and our church.</p>
<p>MOSA is a good context for Service or Fellowship on a broad level.</p>
<p>What can BoSD do for MOSA?</p>
<ul>
<li>Host retreats</li>
<li>host social gatherings</li>
<li>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Is BoSD the inner circel of MOSA? I don’t think so.<br>
Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>That seems exclusive in the wrong way</li>
<li>dilutes the mission of the Brotherhood.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do we provbide for MOSA distinctly from the Brotherhood?</p>
<ol>
<li>A bi-monthly breakfast (2nd Sat of every Odd-numbered month). With some teaching content.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="distinct">Distinct</h2>
<p>I think the Brotherhood needs to be distinct from the generic men’s group.</p>
<p>I believe the response I’ve gotten shows there is a need for the kind of thing I am aiming the Brotherhood to become. Is there a need for Generic Men’s something? Who can lead it?</p>
