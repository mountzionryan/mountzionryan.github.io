### Song of the Pastry
	As the Sirens called to the sailors
	And the Kitsune to the samurai,
	As Delilah seduced Samson
	And Barbara Stanwyck seduced Fred MacMurray,
	So too this box named Krispy Kreme.
	I wield a banana in defiance
	And hold fast.


### I Want an Office with a Window
	The florescent lights, the computer’s fan
	And the air conditioner’s gentle murmur
	Are all the sounds I hear.
	They aspire to be crickets and whippoorwills
	In the meadow of my standard government issued office.
	A box labeled, “Personal desk starter kit”
	Boosts my monitor to eye level.
	How can “21 indispensable office products
	in one convenient kit”
	be personal?


### Coffee and Its Imitators
	There is a great difference
	Between coffee-flavored-water and coffee.
	Like the difference between
	Watching baseball on T.V.
	And playing baseball.
	One is a vital fluid, like blood
	Or the sap of a mighty tree.
	The other is imitative at best, like skim milk
	Or the scent of a scratch-and-sniff sticker.
	Coffee-flavored-water is for people
	Who like to pretend they like coffee
	But don’t.
	So they take their coffee-flavored-water
	the same color as the walls of my office,
	just barely on the brown side of white.
	Coffee-flavored-water drinkers
	Make life hard for coffee drinkers,
	Because they do not know the difference.
	Coffee-flavored-water drinkers
	don’t care which they drink.
	By the time they have diluted their black liquid
	To color of sand, it doesn’t matter
	Whether the office coffee pot contains
	Coffee or its imitators.
