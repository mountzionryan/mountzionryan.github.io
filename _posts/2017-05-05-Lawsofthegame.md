### The IFAB Laws of the Game 2016/2017
The [IFAB](http://www.theifab.com) (henceforth, _The Board_ )is the International Football Association Board. FIFA is a seperate body, with representation on the IFAB.

_The Board's_ function is to regulate the rules of soccer. 

Recently I was looking for the actual rules regarding something, offside maybe,  and took a look at the latest [_Laws of the Game_](http://www.theifab.com/laws) from _The Board_.

They are a work of art! The website is clean and concise and precise. The print version is clean and concise and precise. The rules themselves are written with a zen-like editorial philosophy. Clean, concise, precise. They are the opitome of _Struck and White's_ *Rule 17*<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>.

For example:
>1.2. FIELD MARKINGS
>
>The field of play must be rectangular and marked with continuous lines which must not be dangerous. These lines belong to the areas of which they are boundaries.
>
>Only the lines indicated in Law 1 are to be marked on the field of play.
>
>The two longer boundary lines are touchlines. The two shorter lines are goallines.
>
>The field of play is divided into two halves by a halfway line, which joins the midpoints of the two touchlines.
>
>The centre mark is at the midpoint of the halfway line. A circle with a radius of 9.15 m (10yds) is marked around it.
>

I love the simplcity of the definitions of touchlines and goal lines. It is almost Socrates talking geometry with Meno's servant boy. 

	Socrates:	Do yo know what a Soccer pitch is?
	Boy:			Yes.
	Socrates: 	What are its characteristics. How many sides has it?
	Boy: 			Four.
	Socrates:	Exactly, and are they all the same length?
	Boy:			No, two are long and two are short.
	Socrates:	If we call the long side touchlines and the short sides goallines, do you know what they are?
	Boy:			Yes, clearly.
	

The graphics are likewise simple and clear.

The Laws of the Game are a wonderful reflection of the game itself:

**********************************
<a name="myfootnote1">1</a> For about twenty years my editorial, even my design philosphy can be summed up with *Rule 17*.
>_Rule 17. Omit needless words._

I love Strunk and White. So often a rule is an example of the rule itself. And none moreso than Rule 17.
