<h2 id="saint-cadfan">Saint Cadfan</h2>
<p>Saint Cadfan (Latin: Catamanus), sometimes Anglicized as Gideon, was the 6th century founder-abbot of Tywyn (whose church is dedicated to him) and Bardsey, both in Gwynedd, Wales. He was said to have received the island of Bardsey from Saint Einion Frenin, king of Llŷn, around 516 and to have served as its abbot until 542.</p>
<p>A Breton nobleman, he was said to be the son of Eneas Ledewig (Aeneas of Brittany) and Gwen Teirbron (Gwen Three Breasts), daughter of Budic II of Brittany. He journeyed to Britain accompanied by the children of Ithel Hael o Lydaw (of Brittany): Baglan, Flewyn, Gredifael, Tanwg, Twrog, Tegai, Trillo, Tecwyn and Llechid. Other reputed followers include Maël and Ilar. Wade-Evans thought Kentinlau, who accompanied Cadfan to Ceredigion, should be identified with Cynllo.[6] They may have fled the Franks.</p>
<h2 id="saint-hwywn">Saint Hwywn</h2>
<p>+  516 A companion of St Cadfan on his return journey from Brittany to Cornwall and Wales. By tradition he founded Aberdaron in Gwynedd. Aberdaron was the departure point for Ynys Enli (<em>Bardsey Island</em>).</p>
<h2 id="saint-einion-frenin">Saint Einion Frenin</h2>
<p>+ 590 Saint Einion was a son of Owain Whitetooth (Ddantgwyn) and the brother of Cuneglas, king of Rhos, and of saints Seiriol and Meirion.</p>
<p>Part of Gwynedd’s Cuneddan dynasty, he seems to have ruled as a local king (Latin: regulus) over the Llŷn Peninsula southwest of Anglesey and possibly over Anglesey itself.</p>
<p>He was credited with granting his brother Seiriol the land for his monastery (Welsh: <em>clas</em>) at Penmon on Anglesey and, later, his hermitage on Puffin Island. He also lured the Breton saint Cadfan from Tywyn to found St Mary’s Abbey, the first religious establishment on Bardsey Island.</p>
<p>Although not part of the Cistercian Way, this became a major site of pilgrimage in Wales. Einion himself is sometimes said to have joined Cadfan’s community on the island, although his relics were claimed by the church at Llanengan.</p>
