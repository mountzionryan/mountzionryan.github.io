<h1 id="saints-of-gwynedd">Saints of Gwynedd</h1>
<h2 id="saint-cadfan">Saint Cadfan</h2>
<p>Saint Cadfan (Latin: Catamanus), sometimes Anglicized as Gideon, was the 6th century founder-abbot of Tywyn (whose church is dedicated to him) and Bardsey, both in Gwynedd, Wales. He was said to have received the island of Bardsey from Saint Einion Frenin, king of Llŷn, around 516 and to have served as its abbot until 542.</p>
<p>A Breton nobleman, he was said to be the son of Eneas Ledewig (Aeneas of Brittany) and Gwen Teirbron (Gwen Three Breasts), daughter of Budic II of Brittany. He journeyed to Britain accompanied by the children of Ithel Hael o Lydaw (of Brittany): Baglan, Flewyn, Gredifael, Tanwg, Twrog, Tegai, Trillo, Tecwyn and Llechid. Other reputed followers include Maël and Ilar. Wade-Evans thought Kentinlau, who accompanied Cadfan to Ceredigion, should be identified with Cynllo.[6] They may have fled the Franks.</p>
<h2 id="saint-hwywn">Saint Hwywn</h2>
<p>+  516 A companion of St Cadfan on his return journey from Brittany to Cornwall and Wales. By tradition he founded Aberdaron in Gwynedd. Aberdaron was the departure point for Ynys Enli (<em>Bardsey Island</em>).</p>
<h2 id="saint-einion-frenin">Saint Einion Frenin</h2>
<p>+ 590 Saint Einion was a son of Owain Whitetooth (Ddantgwyn) and the brother of Cuneglas, king of Rhos, and of saints Seiriol and Meirion.</p>
<p>Part of Gwynedd’s Cuneddan dynasty, he seems to have ruled as a local king (Latin: regulus) over the Llŷn Peninsula southwest of Anglesey and possibly over Anglesey itself.</p>
<p>He was credited with granting his brother Seiriol the land for his monastery (Welsh: <em>clas</em>) at Penmon on Anglesey and, later, his hermitage on Puffin Island. He also lured the Breton saint Cadfan from Tywyn to found St Mary’s Abbey, the first religious establishment on Bardsey Island.</p>
<p>Although not part of the Cistercian Way, this became a major site of pilgrimage in Wales. Einion himself is sometimes said to have joined Cadfan’s community on the island, although his relics were claimed by the church at Llanengan.</p>
<h2 id="saint-baglan">Saint Baglan</h2>
<p>Baglan is said, on doubtful evidence, to have been a Breton prince, the son of Ithel Hael. He studied at Saint Illtud’s monastic school at Llanilltud Fawr (Llantwit Major)[1] and later travelled to the Vale of Neath as a missionary. He founded the church at Baglan and lived in a cell adjoining it.[2]</p>
<p>Legend says that he was seen (either by Cadoc or Illtud) carrying fire in his robe without burning it so Illtud gave him a crozier and instructed him to build a church where he found a tree that bore three fruit. He found a tree that had a litter of pigs, a beehive, and a crow’s nest; however, he preferred a spot lower down on the flat (either where St Catherine’s church now stands or further out towards the bay). What was built by day was washed away by night (or disappeared at night, or was moved to the site by the tree at night). Finally, he gave in and built the church by the tree (presumably this site was rebuilt in the medieval period as St Baglan’s church which burned down in 1954[ and is now a sad ruin). The crozier apparently survived until the 17th century.</p>

<p>Cadoc’s story appears in a <em>Vita Cadoci</em> written shortly before 1086 by Lifris of Llancarfan;(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-4">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-4</a>) “it was clearly written at Llancarfan with the purpose of honouring the house and confirming its endowments,”(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-5">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-5</a>) Consequently, it is of limited historical merit though some details are of interest. Llancarfan did not survive the intrusion of Norman power into South Wales, being dissolved about 1086.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-6">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-6</a>)</p>
<p>Cadoc began life under a cloud of violence. His father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwynllyw" title="Gwynllyw">Gwynllyw</a> the Bearded, was one of the lesser kings of Wales, a brother of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petroc" title="Saint Petroc">Saint Petroc</a>, and a robber chieftain. He wanted to propose to Princess Gwladys, daughter of King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brychan" title="Brychan">Brychan</a> of Brycheiniog, a neighboring chieftain, but Brychan turned away the envoys asking for Gwladys’ hand. Wildly in love, Gwynllyw and Gwladys eloped from her father’s court at Brecon and escaping over the mountains(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-gray-7">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-gray-7</a>) in a raid in which 200 of Gwynllyw’s 300 followers perished.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-brookline-8">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-brookline-8</a>)</p>
<p>Born into the royal families of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwynllwg" title="Gwynllwg">Gwynllwg</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brycheiniog" title="Brycheiniog">Brycheiniog</a>, it is said, he worked miracles even before his birth. Strange lights shone in his parents’ house and the cellars were miraculously filled with food.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-gray-7">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-gray-7</a>)</p>
<p>Cadoc was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouthshire" title="Monmouthshire">Monmouthshire</a>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-9">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-9</a>) around the year 497. An angel announced his birth and summoned the hermit Meuthi to baptise and teach him. A holy well sprang up for his baptism and afterwards flowed with wine and milk.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-gray-7">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-gray-7</a>) It is thought that he was baptised as Cathmail (Cadfael).(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-west-10">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadoc#cite_note-west-10</a>) After the birth of his son, Gwynllyw went on a wild celebratory raid with a new band of fearless warriors. Among other livestock, he stole the cow of an Irish monk, St. Tathyw of Caerwent . This is probably Tathan, a reputed early abbot of nearby Caerwent whose dedications appear around Llantwit Major Tathyw was not afraid of Gwynllyw and boldly went to confront him, demanding the return of the cow. On a sudden impulse, or perhaps guided by divine inspiration, Gwynllyw decided Cadoc would go to live under the monk’s care, and he was sent away to be educated at Tathyw’s monastery in Caerwent. Cadoc picked up a basic knowledge of Latin and received a rudimentary education that prepared him for further studies in Ireland and Wales. Most important, Cadoc learned to appreciate the life of a monk and a priest.</p>
<p>One day while in the Cardiff district of Glamorganshire, Cadoc was being chased by an armed swineherd from an enemy tribe. As he ran through the woods looking for a place to hide, he came upon a wild boar, white with age. Disturbed by his presence, the boar made three fierce bounds in his direction, but Cadoc’s life was spared when the boar miraculously disappeared. Cadoc took this as a heavenly sign, and marked the spot with three tree branches. The valley was owned by his uncle, King Pawl of Penychen, who made a present of the land to his nephew. The location later became the site of the great church college and monastery at Llancarvan.</p>
<p>Maches (Latin: <em>Machuta</em>), the sister of Cadoc according to tradition, was killed by robbers who were stealing her finest ram. Tathan, to whom the murderers confessed their crime, built a church on the spot.</p>
<p>In adulthood Cadoc refused to take charge of his father’s army, “preferring to fight for Christ”. He founded his first monastery at Llancarfan in the Vale of Glamorgan, and from there he went to Ireland to study for three years. Returning to Wales, he studied with Bachan or Pachan, a [teacher of rhetoric] from Italy. He then travelled to Scotland where he founded a monastery at Cambuslang. Back at Llancarfan, his influence helped it to grow into one of the chief monasteries in South Wales.</p>
<p>One tradition has it that he went on pilgrimage to Rome, but more certain is the knowledge of time spent in Brittany. He settled there on an island in the Etel river, now called L’Ile de Cado, where he built an oratory, founded a monastery and devoted himself to spreading the Gospel.There are chapels dedicated to him at Belz and Locoal-Mendon in Morbihan and at Gouesnac’h in Finistère       , where he is called upon to cure the deaf. His name is also the basis of some thirty Breton place-names.</p>
