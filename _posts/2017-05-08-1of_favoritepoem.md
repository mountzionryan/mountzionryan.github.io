	My wife and I vowed       
	to live together   
				into new ages,   
	our bonds unbreakable
	like a cord of jewels,
	until our black hair
	(side by side when we slpet,
	crossing our white sleeves
	and swaying to each other)
	turned white.
	Our vows unfulfilled;
	our desires unrealized,
	she has left my white-sleeved arms
	and departed from the house
					of her peaceful life,
	leaving our crying child.
	
	She has passed
	beyond the edge
					of Sagara Mountain
					in Yamashiro,
	fading like the morning mist.
	There is nothing I can say,
					nothing I can do.
	In the mornings I go out
	from the marriage hut
	where we slept together,
				and remember.
	In the evenings
	I go inside
				and grieve.
	
	Each time our child
	cries in my arms
	I, though a man,
	bear it on my back
	and hold it close to me.
	Weeping and crying aloud
	like morning birds,
	I long for her,
	but there is no use.
	Though it is a thing
	that cannot speak,
	I find myslef drawn
	to the mountain
	where my wife has gone inside.
	
			~envoys~
	
			A matter of life's transience
			the mountain
			I used to glance at casually
			now is precious to me
	
	
			I shall go on weeping
			and crying aloud
			like the morning birds,
			for there is no way for me
			to meet my wife again.
